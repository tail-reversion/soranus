# The Soranus Class

This is an experimental class that is _somewhat_ functional but _not_ useful. It is (eventually) intended for general use, i.e. technical reports, journal articles, books of all kinds, &c. My hope is that even document authors and designers outside of mathematics and the natural sciences and will find this class both valuable and pleasant to use.

Named after [the Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Valerius_Soranus "Quintus Valerius Soranus") who is credited with inventing the table of contents.

## Documentation

LaTeXed documentation will be produced when the class is ready to publish to [CTAN](https://ctan.org). However, online documentation can be found at [the Wiki](https://github.com/tail-reversion/soranus/wiki).

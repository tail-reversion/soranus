## Code Style

This is a LaTeX3 class, so code should be written in the expl3 language, following the standard style defined by the LaTeX3 team (see `texdoc expl3` for a style overview and `texdoc interface3` for documentation on the expl3 language). The class namespace is `soranus`, and `xtemplate` variables should have the namespace `soranus_templatename`. When it is necessary to use a TeX primitive, define a wrapper command (_e.g._ wrap `\tex_pagewidth:D` as `\g__soranus_paper_width_dim`).
